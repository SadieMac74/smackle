          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>Midland Automation Technology Ltd (MATL) was formed in 1993 as a limited company with many years of electrical, controls and automation experience in the industries of water and wastewater, biomass handling, energy from waste, chemicals, pharmaceutical, packaging and food. We also have resource available to develop mechanical designs and drawings and 3D CAD.
          <br/>Our aim is to be professional, approachable and flexible. We build up strong and long-lasting relationships with clients, but provide the level of confidentiality that should be expected from our type of business.
          <br/>Our services can provide either a comprehensive support to supplement in-house resources at a range of levels and at various points in the project cycle, or a complete design solution from initial concept through to construction completion and beyond.
          <br/>Regardless of the role we play in a project, we are always keenly aware of the need to manage cost, time and quality.

            <h2>Our Focus</h2>
            <p>Our efforts have been successfully focussed within part of contractor organisations to drive information management to a level where consistency of quality is targeted, unnecessary duplication eliminated, changes become less necessary due to earlier planning and an audit trail becomes a reality.
            <br />It is difficult to over-emphasise the importance of planning at an early stage. When the client knows exactly what they are getting, the expectations are under control â€“ they know that a change will have an impact on the delivery of the project, not least on the financial side.
            <br/> When the suppliers know exactly what they are supplying, the risk of contractual conflict is dramatically reduced.
            <br/> In terms of the delivery of a project, accurate information at an early stage ensures that delivery is on time, savings can be made, errors can be designed out rather than fixed at commissioning and the project is a winner.
            <br/>In our view, the most successful projects are the ones which raise the fewest headlines.
